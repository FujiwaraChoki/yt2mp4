            <h6>Hi welcome, </h6>

            <p>
                We are a team of passionate developers who love YouTube and want to make it easier for people to download their favorite videos as MP4 files. We started this project as a hobby and a challenge, and we are proud of what we have achieved so far.
            </p>

            <p>
                We use TypeScript, Next.js and pico.css to create a simple and responsive website that can convert any YouTube video into an MP4 file in seconds. We also use various APIs and libraries to handle the video processing and downloading.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is to provide a free and reliable service that anyone can use for personal or educational purposes. We respect the rights of the content owners and do not encourage any illegal or unethical use of our platform. We also do not store or share any user data or video files.
            </p>
